Conflicting Emotions rule: Be Honest with Yourself!

I opted to be polite to a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyone—especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt. There was no attraction, I was not into the person. I should not sacrifice my well-being and putting myself into an uncomfortable position just because they're going to have an in a couple of days interview. Be honest with yourself! It will sting, but it's like plucking a thorn where it will feel good after the initial sting.
