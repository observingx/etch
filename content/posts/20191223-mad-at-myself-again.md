Romance Rule: Do not go in blindly. Are you even attracted to the person as a whole: looks and personality?  @Mad at Myself (again) during Holidays

Event Date: 12/22/2019 Sunday

Writing Date: 12/23/2019 Monday (Early Morning after I got home from the hookup)

I met up with Yaro(?) tonight: went straight to his apartment. He lives with other people, so we went to his room right away. I'm mad at myself because I went directly to his room, a very intimate confine, without screening/filtering if we were a match. I should have met up with him at a common place first, and should have known what his personality was like or if I was attracted to him at all. Anyways, when we met, he did not look very much like his photos. The photos on his Grindr were not very accurate representation of him. 

This has happened in the past too. The last time, I met up with a premed neighbor. I had an inkling that I was not into him, but I did not trust my instinct—this decision hurt me. Also, I should have asked for more face and body pics rather than meeting him after 2 pics. 

A similar incident in NYC happened too. When I met up with that "bi" Italian guy in NYC, the problem with that was 2 folds: (1) I did not ask for clear face pics, and (2) I was not candid from the start that I was not into him despite meeting up in a public space first. Though, I was hopeful he had a good body and waited till the winter jackets were off—maybe next time sit inside an even-temperatured location where winter jackets would have to be removed?

Remember, it's okay to ask for more pics. It's okay to delay meeting up. It's okay to go to the restroom and think about things. It's NOT okay to do things out of social politeness.

Finally, I am mad at myself because I might have ruined my car a little tonight. I accidentally drove over an "island" on a regular road. It was like driving over a hump with decent speed. 

The moral of these stories are:
---

* Romance Rule: Do not go in blindly. Get to know the person if they're the type you're willing to bed with. Is there even an attraction? Perhaps meet up somewhere first?
* You do not have to break anyone's hearts, especially not your own. Hence, be honest with yourself and always convey whole message: state what I observe, think, feel, and need.
