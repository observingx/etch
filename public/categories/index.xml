      <description>Event date: Saturday, 11 Jul 2020
Writing date: Saturday, 11 Jul 2020
Been talking to this guy, Joey, since morning. I thought he was perfect: face, body, ass. As we were talking throughout the day (i.e., daytime), I bought in to the hope that we would meet up later that night. However, come six o&amp;rsquo;clock evening, Joey bailed and had to go to Walmart. LOL. After that, I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening.</description>
