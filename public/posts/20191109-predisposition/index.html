<p>I was automatically polite towards a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyoneâ€”especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt. There was no attraction, I was not into the person. I should not sacrifice my well-being and putting myself into an uncomfortable position just because they&rsquo;re going to have a grad school healthcare interview the next day. Be honest with yourself! It will sting, but it&rsquo;s like plucking a thorn where it will feel good after the initial sting.</p>
<p>In order to cope with this yucky feeling of betraying myself, I played online chess for 5 straight hours that night when I got home. I just wanted to forget whatever happened that night.</p>
<p>What I could have done differently next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be honest with yourself.</li>
<li>Honestly describe your emotions: no attraction, did not want to be there naked</li>
<li>Honestly describe the conflict, if any: Saving yourself from a sex you did not want to be part of VS. Making yourself not look like an asshole (was the latter really a win?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons to Practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know thyself: When meeting a <strong>stranger</strong>, your predisposition has always been to be polite (to the point of sacrificing yourself) in favor of not causing unhappines to  that stranger.</li>
<li>What should you do? &ndash; <strong>Communicate.</strong> A simple statement to verbally communicate how you feel is enough to do the job: &ldquo;Imma be honest. I&rsquo;m not feeling it. Thank you for the time.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
