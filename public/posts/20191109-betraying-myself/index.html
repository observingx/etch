<p>Event date: Friday, 08 Nov 2019</p>

<p>I opted to be polite to a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyoneâ€”especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt. There was no attraction, I was not into the person. I should not sacrifice my well-being and putting myself into an uncomfortable position just because they&rsquo;re going to have an in a couple of days interview. Be honest with yourself! It will sting, but it&rsquo;s like plucking a thorn where it will feel good after the initial sting.</p>
<p>In order to cope with this yucky feeling of betraying myself, I played online chess for 5 straight hours that night when I got home. I just wanted to forget whatever happened that night.</p>
