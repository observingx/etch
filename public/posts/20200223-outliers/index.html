        <h1>Outliers</h1><time>February 23, 2020</time></header><p>A book on why  certain people are successful.</p>
<p>I finished reading  Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s Outlier book after a month (I took my time, reading about one chapter at a time). The overall takeaway message was that these people we see as &ldquo;outliers,&rdquo; were not outliers at all. &ldquo;They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luckyâ€”but all critical to making them who are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Gladwell&rsquo;s message. I might be slightly biased because I&rsquo;ve always erred on the side of &ldquo;practice, practice, practice.&rdquo; The book points out age-old adaged like &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; (as in the case of success for The Beatles, Mozart, Bill Gates), legacy (as in the case of Asian Math wizards with rice-paddy background instead of wheat, Korean pilots), being born at the right time/place (Bill Gates, NHL players), and more.</p>
<p>One thing that was eye-opening for me was how airplane crashes was tied to the culture of the pilots. Gladwell looked at specific cases of a Korean airline and a Colombian airline. The not-so-direct and &ldquo;mitigating&rdquo; form of talking from those cultures were the main cause of these crashes. It was eye-opening for me because I never considered cultures of pilot when selecting my flights. From now on, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d take into account.</p>
<p>As for the book&rsquo;s readability, the superficial presentation (e.g., font-size, book&rsquo;s thickness, etc.) allows it to be very readable for most ages, even those in high school. The book is an easy read and has vocabulary that is not too convoluted.</p></article>
